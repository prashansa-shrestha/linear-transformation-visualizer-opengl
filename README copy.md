# Linear Transformation Visualizer

## Background
We use matrices throughout multiple fields of mathematics, but we seldom quite "see" what changes these matrices make.
A matrix with 0 as its determinant is non-invertible. But we can't really tell the reason behind it.

This project is an effort to visualize the mathematics that we've studied in our high school years: Linear Transformations

Highly inspired by 3Blue1Brown's work in visualizing mathematics, Linear Transformation Visualizer aims for a similar goal: for you to become clearer on what mathematics truly represents

## Some maths insights

In linear algebra, every linear transformation can be represented by a **matrix**.
Upon matrix multiplication, the entire space changes its dimenison: it stretches, rotates, reflects or skews.
And this program allows you to see the phenomenon!

**Note:**
* Determinant = Volume scaling factor
* Negative determinant ‚Üí Orientation reversal

And what happens when the matrix is non-invertible? Run it to find out ;)
