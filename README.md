# Linear Transformation Visualizer

## Background
We use matrices throughout multiple field of mathematics, but we seldom quite "see" what changes these matrices make.
A matrix cannot have 0 as its determinant. But we can't really tell the reason behind it.

This project is an effort to visualize the mathematics that we've studied in our high school years: Linear Transformations

Highly inspired by 3Blue1Brown and his efforts in visualizing mathematics, Linear Transformation Visualizer attempts for a similar goal: for you to become clearer what mathematics means  

A **3D interactive visualizer** that demonstrates how **linear transformations** affect objects and coordinate spaces.
It allows users to **apply, animate, and explore** transformations such as rotations, scaling, reflections, and shears ‚Äî all through a real-time rendered cube and grid using **OpenGL**, **Pygame**, and a **Tkinter** matrix input GUI.

## Some maths insights

In linear algebra, every linear transformation can be represented by a **matrix**.
Upon matrix multiplication, the entire space changes it's dimenison: it stretches, rotates, reflects or skews.
And this program allows you to see the phenomenon!

**Note:**
* Determinant = Volume scaling factor
* Negative determinant ‚Üí Orientation reversal
  
And what happens when the matrix is non-invertible? Run it to find out ;)

## Instructions to Run

### 1. Install dependencies

Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

Then run:

```bash
pip install pygame PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate numpy
```

### 2. Run the program

```bash
python linear_transformation_visualizer.py
```

## Troubleshooting

* If you see an error like `No module named 'OpenGL'` ‚Üí Run
  `pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate`
* If GUI doesn‚Äôt show up ‚Üí Ensure Tkinter is installed (it comes by default with most Python distributions)
* Some systems may require a restart after installing `pygame` and `PyOpenGL`.

Would you like me to make a **shorter ‚Äústudent-project style‚Äù version** of this README (for submissions or portfolio use)? I can simplify the tone and formatting while keeping it polished.
